Horizontal escape route design

Means of escape should be provided from any point on a floor to an exit from the floor. The general principle is that any person confronted by a fire within a building can turn away from it and escape safely.


In certain
conditions
 , typically classrooms, a single direction of escape (a dead end condition) can be accepted as providing reasonable safety providing that the recommendations of
Table 1 on travel distances
 in a single direction is met and the
occupancy of the space is limited to 60
 .




Number of escape routes and exits, and limits on travel distance


The number of
escape routes
 and exits to be provided depends on the number of occupants in the room, tier or storey in question and the
limits on travel distance to the nearest exit given in Table 1
 .


It is only the distance to the nearest exit that needs to meet the recommendations. The other exits may be further away and in multi-storey buildings, more than one stair will be needed for escape.

 In many cases, there will not be an alternative at the beginning of the route. For example, there may be only one exit from a room to a corridor, from which point escape is possible in two directions. A single route is acceptable for parts of a floor from which a storey exit or escape in two directions can be reached within the travel distance limit for travel in one direction set in Table 1. Figure 1 shows an example of a dead-end condition in an open plan layout.

Very young children (nursery, reception and infant class) will move more slowly than older children or adults and require constant supervision and direction during egress. Having direct access to an external place of safety from their classrooms is an advantage.



Number of occupants and exits


The value used for the number of occupants will normally be that specified as the basis for the design.
When the
number of occupants
 likely to use
a
room
 ,
tier
 or
storey
 is not known,
the capacity should be calculated according to the appropriate floor space factors (see
Table 2
 ).





Table 3
 gives the minimum number of escape routes and exits
from a room
or
storey
 according
to
 the number of occupants. The number of exits may have to be increased to comply with the limits on travel distances given in Table 1.




Alternative escape routes

A choice of escape routes is of little value if two or more are likely to be disabled simultaneously.

 Alternative escape routes

 should therefore satisfy the following criteria:


they are in
directions 45o or more apart
 (see Figure 1); or



they are in
directions less than 45o apart
 , but are
separated from each other by fire-resisting construction





Inner rooms

A room from which the only escape route is through another room is called an

inner room
 .
 Classrooms can be inner rooms when the corridor that they escape into is used as a teaching space or for other purposes, rather than just for circulation. The risk is that if a fire starts in the access room it could prejudice escape from the inner room. Such an arrangement is acceptable providing that the following conditions are satisfied:


the
occupant capacity of the inner room does not exceed 60
 and the
access room is not a place of special fire hazard




the
escape route from the inner room does not pass through more than one access room



the travel distance from any point in the inner room to the exit(s) from the access room does not exceed the appropriate limit given in Table 1

one of the following arrangements is made:


the
enclosures (walls or partitions) of the inner room are stopped at least 500mm below the ceiling
 ; or



a suitably sited

 vision panel

 not less than
0.1m2


is located in the door
 or
walls of the inner room
 ,
 to enable occupants of the inner room to see if a fire has started in the outer room; or




the access room is fitted with a suitable automatic fire detection
 and
alarm system
 to warn the occupants of the inner room of the outbreak of a fire in the access room




Open Plan



Escape routes
should not be within 4.5m of open connections between floors
 .
Where an
open-plan
space
connects more than one storey
 ,

rooms accessed from the space should be treated as inner rooms
 with the
space
 /balcony regarded as the access room.
 Any escape routes should not be compromised by openings in floors and this will be achieved by ensuring that:


the
direction of travel is away from the opening
 (e.g. A-B in Figure 2a); or



there is an alternative
escape route
does not pass within 4.5m of the opening
 (e.g. the rooms with
alternative
 exits in Figure 2b)



If the

opening
passes through a compartment floor

(see Section 13), the guidance given in
Annex B of BS 9999
 , "Recommendations for atria", should be followed for fire precautions in atria.





In

schools
fitted with sprinklers
 ,

rooms which are accessed
 by an
open
balcony
less than 4.5m wide
 , and which
do not have an alternative escape route away from the balcony
 , should satisfy the following conditions (see Figure 2b):


 escape from any point on the
balcony
 should be
available in at least two directions



the travel distance along the balcony should not exceed 18m




Access to stairways


Unless the
doors
 to a
protected stairway
 and any
associated exit passageway
are fitted with an automatic release mechanism
 , the stairway and any associated exit passageway
should not form part of the primary circulation route between different parts of the building at the same level
 . This is because the self-closing fire doors are more likely to be rendered ineffective because of their constant use by, for example, being wedged open or having their closers removed.




Escape routes and exits

The minimum clear headroom height in
 escape routes
should not be less than 2m
 , except in doorways .

 For escape purposes, the minimum corridor width of 1200mm recommended by AD M is sufficient if the corridor is not expected to serve as means of escape for more than 250 people . If the number of people is greater than this , the minimum width should be increased by an additional 50mm for each additional 10 persons (or part of 10). However, larger corridor widths will generally be needed in schools to cope with class changeovers and inclusion of lockers.

 The aggregate width of all the escape routes should be not less than that required to accommodate the maximum numbers of people likely to use them. Where the maximum number of people likely to use the escape route and exit is not known, the appropriate capacity should be based on the occupant capacity (see Table 2).



Discounting exits




Where
 a
storey
 or
room
has more than one exit
 ,
 it must be assumed that a fire might prevent the occupants from using one of them. Therefore, when deciding on the
total width of exits needed the largest exit should be discounted
 . Table 4 gives the required exit width against a maximum number of persons. It should be noted that the required storey exit width can affect the required stair width because
stairs need to be at least as wide as any storey exit leading onto them
 . Table 5, provides the minimum clear width of doors, recommended in AD M.





Where a ground floor storey exit shares a final exit with a stair via a ground floor lobby
 , the
width of the final exit should be sufficient to enable a maximum evacuation flow rate equal to or greater than that from the storey exit and stair combined
 (see Figure 3).


This can be calculated from the following formula:

WW = ((N/2.5)+(60SS))/80 Where:W = width of final exit, in metresN = number of people served by ground floor storey exitS = stair width in metres



Worked example

A ground floor storey exit serving 250 persons shares a common final exit with a 1.2m wide stair. Required final exit = ((250/2.5)+(60*1.2))/80=2.150m



Corridors



Where a
corridor
is used for means of escape
 , but
it is not a protected corridor
 and
is enclosed by non-fire-resistant partitions
 ,
the

   partitions

 should be

carried up to the soffit of the floor above
 ,
 or
to a suspended ceiling
 .

 They will then provide some defence against the spread of smoke in the early stages of a fire, but the rooms do not need to be provided with fire doors.



 If a
corridor
provides access to alternative escape routes
 , there is a risk that smoke will spread along it and make both routes impassable.
To avoid this, every

corridor
more than 12m long
 that
connects two or more storey exits
 ,
should
be sub-divided by one or more self-closing fire doors
 and
any necessary associated screens
 .

The

fire doors
 (and
any
 associated
screens
 )

should
be positioned approximately mid-way between the two storey exits
 to effectively safeguard the route from smoke, taking account of the layout of the corridor and any adjacent fire risks, see Figure 4.





Where a
cavity exists above
 the
enclosures
 to
such a corridor
 ,
 because the enclosing materials are not carried up to the underside of the floor or roof above,

cavity barriers should be fitted on the line of the enclosures to
 and
across the corridor
 to prevent smoke bypass.
Any

door
 that could
provide a path for smoke to bypass the sub-division

should be made
self-closing
 , but need not necessarily be fire-resisting.






Dead-end corridors




Dead-end
corridors

 should be avoided when it is practical to do so, but where they are present, they should
be enclosed in fire resistant construction up to the point that escape becomes available in two directions
 .
 The need to provide a protected corridor does not apply to short

 recesses of less than 2m

 ; or

longer corridors
serving rooms with limited fire risk
 , e.g. toilet accommodation.





When a
dead-end
corridor
 is
longer than 4.5 m

it should be provided with
self- closing fire doors
 (with
smoke seals
 ) to
separate it from where escape becomes available in more than one direction
 , or
where the corridor continues past one storey exit to another
 .





External escape routes



Where an
external
escape route
 (other than a
stair
 ) is
beside an external wall of the building
 ,

that part of the external wall within 1800mm of the escape route should be of fire-resisting construction
 ,
up to a height of 1100mm above the paving level of the route
 .





Security


Security is an important consideration for school buildings, leading to the need for

doors
 to be
secured against entry

 , including when the school is occupied. This is acceptable, as long as these

 doors are provided with suitable emergency hardware

 , often referred to as 'panic hardware' to ensure that they can be opened whenever the need arises.

Electrically powered

locks
 should
fail-safe open on alarm
 and
loss of power
 or
by the activation of a manual release unit (Type A) to BS 7273-4
 ,
positioned on the side of the door that the escaping occupants are approaching
 .

 in multi-storey buildings is the availability of enough adequately sized and protected escape stairs. Helical stiars, spiral stairs and fixed ladders cannot be used as part of an escape route for pupils in schools, or for members of the public, and single steps should be avoided.
Only
firefighting lifts
complying with BS EN 81-72
 (and prior to firefighters' arrival)
and
evacuation lifts
complying with BS EN 81-20
 ,
BS EN 81-70
 and
Annex G of BS 9999
 ,
 should be used for escape purposes - see Section 26 and Appendix B.




Number of escape stairs

The number of escape stairs needed in a building (or part of a building) will be determined by satisfying travel distances requirements, while allowing for the possibility that a stair may have to be discounted for escape purposes because of fire or smoke.

In buildings with an occupied storey 7.5m above Fire and Rescue Service access level, some escape stairs will also need to form part of a fire-fighting shaft. (See Section 24).



Single escape stairs




New
 ,
multi-storey
school

buildings


must have at least two staircases
 .
 Single escape stairs are not acceptable.




Width and capacity of escape stairs

The tables and exit sizes given in this document are based on simultaneous evacuation, where all occupants leave the building on sounding of the fire alarm. Most schools follow simultaneous evacuation, even when the site comprises separate buildings, because it offers the advantages of simplicity and enables all the occupants to be quickly accounted for at the assembly point. However, for special schools where the occupants may require more assistance, progressive horizontal evacuation (PHE) or phased evacuation may be appropriate. This is where only the occupants in immediate danger are evacuated - typically to an adjacent compartment. This enables staff to concentrate their efforts where it is most needed. Should it be deemed desirable to follow PHE or phased evacuation, specialist advice should be sought on the sizing of escape stairs and exits.


For
simultaneous evacuation
 ,

each
stair
should
 be wide enough to accommodate the number of persons needing to use it in an emergency, with the
minimum width of 1100mm
 , serving up to 220 people. When designing for greater numbers of people, the capacity of stairs of widths from 1100 to 1800mm is given in Table 6.



Where the
maximum number of people
 needing to use the
escape
stairs
 is not known , the
occupant capacity should be calculated based on the appropriate floor space factors as set out in Table 2
 .


The width of
escape
stairs
 should:


not be less than the storey exits serving them



not reduce in width at any point on the way to a final exit



To follow the guidance in AD M, and to satisfy general circulation requirements in schools, the minimum widths may need to be increased.
For example, a minimum
 stair
width
 of 1600mm is commonly recommended
 for new secondary schools for circulation purposes.
Where the

width of the stair is more than 1800mm
 ,
the
stair should be provided with a central handrail
 (for safety reasons
in accordance with the guidance in AD K
 ) and the
capacity of each side of the stair should be considered separately
 .


When appropriate
 a
second handrail at low height
 should
be provided
 for younger children.





Discounting of stairs


Where two or more
stairs
are
 provided,
 it should be assumed that one of them might not be available due to fire.
Therefore, it is necessary to
discount each stair in turn to ensure that the capacity of the remaining stair(s) is adequate for the number of persons needing to escape
 . This applies to a building with or without a fire suppression system.


It is not necessary to discount a stair when they or the building have one of the following additional fire protection measure:


the stairs
are protected by a smoke control system
designed in accordance with EN 12101-6
 , or




each stair is approached on each storey through a protected lobby
 (a protected lobby need not be provided on the topmost storey for this exception still to apply)



In such cases, the likelihood of a stair not being available is significantly reduced and it is not necessary to discount one, but
a storey exit should still be discounted
 .


Stair widths for escape derived from Table 6 may often be less than that required for safe carry down, 1600mm for three person and 1700mm for 4 man carry down. In these circumstances, the school should recognise this and ensure that additional equipment is provided to enable safe carry down (see Section 25 for more detail).



Protected stairways, access lobbies and corridors


Every

internal
escape
stair


should be a protected stairway
within a fire-resisting enclosure
 .


An

unprotected
accommodation
stair

may
form part of an internal route
 to a
storey exit
 or
final exit
 ,

 provided that

the distance of travel
 and
the number of people involved are limited
 .



An

escape
stair
needs the added protection of

a protected lobby
 or
protected corridor
 , except for the
top storey
 , where:

the stair
is a fire-fighting stair
 or


it is needed so that one stairway is not discounted when calculating stair widths
 , or

where
 the building is designed for phased evacuation




A protected lobby should also be provided
 between an
escape
stair
 and
a place of special fire hazard
 . In this case,
the lobby should have not less than 0.4 m2 of permanent ventilation
 .




Provision of refuges and evacuation lifts

The school fire safety management plans need to ensure that there are adequate provisions and resources to be able to assist mobility-impaired people to a place of safety outside the building.

It is best practice to provide an evacuation lift, which offers a safer and more dignified way for evacuating occupants with limited mobility from upper floors, and this is now a requirement. The lift installation will need to be appropriately sited and protected and may need to contain a number of safety features that are intended to ensure that the lift remains usable for evacuation purposes during the fire (see Appendix B).

The minimum number of evacuation lifts and the minimum inner dimensions of lift cars in mainstream schools should be related to the number of pupils and storeys served:




for

schools
 with
no more than two storeys
 and
fewer than 900 pupils
 ,


a single evacuation lift
of

1400mm
 x
1100mm
 (internally)







for
 larger
schools
 on at
least three floors

and

900 pupils or more
 ,

a
single
two wheelchair
 lift of
2000mm
 x
1400mm
 ,
or
two lifts
 of
1400mm
 x
1100mm
 (internally) adequately separated on plan





Depending on the layout of the school, it may be necessary to provide
refuges
 as well. These are places of safety where mobility-impaired people can wait until they are escorted out of the building and these are usually in a protected stairway or lobby (see Figure 5). They should be a minimum of
900mm
 x
1400mm
 - see Section 26 for more details.


Note: In this example, the landing is larger to allow access to the wheelchair space without disrupting the flow of persons escaping.



For

special schools
 ,

the evacuation lift provision should be determined on an individual basis
 ,
 but subject to a default minimum of:




for
 all
multi-storey
special schools
 ,
a lift


of
2000mm
 x
1400mm
 (
internally
 )






for
 all
non-ambulant
8
special schools
 ,
a two wheelchair lift


of
2400mm
 x

1400mm

 (
internally
 )





Use of space within protected stairways

A

protected
stairway

 needs to

be free of potential sources of fire

 and only the following facilities may be incorporated into them:




sanitary accommodation
 or
washrooms
 , so long as
the accommodation is not used as a cloakroom
 .
A
gas water heat
 or
sanitary towel incinerator
 may be installed in the accommodation, but
no other gas appliances






a lift well
 if it is
not a firefighting stair





a reception desk
 or
enquiry office area
at ground or access level
 , if
it is not in the only stair serving the building or part of the building
 . The reception or enquiry office
area should not exceed 10m2 in size





cupboards
enclosed with fire-resisting construction
 ,
if they are not in the only stair serving the building or part of the building





Construction of escape stairs

The
 flights and landings of
escape
stairs

should be
constructed of materials achieving Class A2-s1,d0 or better

 in the following situations:


if the
escape stair is within a basement storey




if the
escape stair serves any storey that has a floor level more than 18m above ground or access level




if the
escape stair is a firefighting stair




if the
escape stair is external
 , except
where the stair connects the ground floor or ground level with a floor or flat roof
 a
maximum of 6m above
 or
below ground level



Materials achieving Class B-s3,d2 or worse may be added to the top horizontal surface, except in firefighting stairs.




Risers
should

 generally

not be more than 160mm
 , with
 treads between
250mm
 and
280mm
 (preferred in Part M), and there
should be between 3
 and
16 treads per flight
 .
The length of any landing on a staircase should be
at least the width of the stair
 , and there should
be a change of direction at least every two flights
 .





External walls of protected stairways


With some configurations, a fire in one part of a building could subject the external wall of a protected stairway to heat - for example, where the two are adjacent at an internal angle in the facade as shown in Figure 6. If the external wall of the protected stairway has little fire resistance, there is a risk that this could prevent the safe use of the stair. Therefore if a
protected
stairway
projects beyond
 ,
is recessed from
 , or
is in an internal angle of the adjoining external wall of the building
 ,
the distance between any unprotected areas in the external enclosures to the building should be at least 1800mm from any unprotected area in the enclosure to the stairway
 .




External escape stairs


Some of the escape routes from a storey or part of the building may be by way of an
external
escape
stair
 , if there is


at least one internal escape stair from every part of each storey
 , excluding
plant areas
 .




Where
external
stairs
 are acceptable as
forming part of an escape route
 , they should meet the following provisions:



all

doors
giving access to the stair

should be
fire-resisting
 and
self-closing
 ,

except at the head of any stair leading downwards
 where
there is only one exit from the building onto the top landing





any part of the external envelope of the building within 1800mm of (and 9m vertically below), the flights and landings of an external escape stair should be of fire-resisting construction, except that the 1800mm dimension may be reduced to 1100mm above the top level of the stair (see
Figure 7
 )




there is protection by fire-resisting construction for any part of the building (including any doors) within 1800mm of the escape route from the stair to a place of safety
 , unless
there is a choice of routes from the foot of the stair that would enable the people escaping to avoid exposure to the effects of the fire in the adjoining building




any stair
more than 6m in vertical extent
is protected from the effects of bad weather





glazing
 in areas of fire-resisting construction mentioned
 above
should also be fire-resisting and of normal
integrity performance
 .

Additional insulation performance
 will be required where a
risk assessment indicates that the potential fire hazard requires protection against heat in the post flashover phase
